## Contents:

1. 01_Data : Contains the data files used in this proejct,
   - the 01_Raw subfolder has the raw data sourced from external sources
   - The 02_Processed subfolder has the intermediate and final data sets generated by the codes in this project
2. 02_Codes : Contains all the codes used in this project:
   in general the .ipynb files have been used for EDA and Analysis purposes, the .py scripts are used for the final genration of data and results
   - 01_Population subfolder contains the codes to process the population dataset
   - 02_Mortality subfodler contains the codes to process the mortality data and to generate the plots
   - 03_Shipment subfodler contains the codes to process the shipment data and to generate the plots
   - 04_Other subfolder contains old and redundant files which are not required for the project but have been kept for reference purposes
3. 03_Plots :  Contains the output plots generated by the codes which are organised under the relevant subfolders
4. 04_Documents : Contains reference documents and reports submitted during the project

## Instructions:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Download the raw shipment data from the following [Link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2019/07/18/how-download-use-dea-pain-pills-database/?arc404=true)
3. Rest of the required raw data is already present in the repository
4. To genrate the outputs, run the .py script files in the order of Folder and Order within the folder, i.e. execute the codes is 01_Population then 02_Mortality etc. and follow the order within these folders
5. The output data will be saved in the "02_Processed" subfolder under "01_Data" folder and the plots will be saved under the relevant subfolders in "03_Plots"

Note: except 01_shipment_combine.py, all other files can be run directly since the source data is present within the directory and their relative paths are already added in the codes.
for 01_shipment_combine.py, update it to the local path of the data you downloaded in step 2 in your system before executing it.
